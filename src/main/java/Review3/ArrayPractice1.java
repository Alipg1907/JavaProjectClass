//Arrays:
//Arrays help us store multiple objects of the same type in just one variable.
//They are index based datastructures. Every item that we store inside an array is
// assigned a number that number is called index.
// whenever we want to get any value from the array we provide that index.
// Why we should use arrays:
// We can use multiple variable as well to store multiple items but
// when the data is large it almost impossible to handle the variables.
//imagine we have store the names all the people live in city.
//Syntax:
//There are two ways of creating an array.
//1)DataType []nameOfArray={element1,element2,element3}
//   example=     int [] ages={25,32,29,45};
//2) DataType [] nameOfArray= new DataType[Size]
