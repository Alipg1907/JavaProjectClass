///Object ooriented  programing (OOP)
// it is just a way ( set of rules) of writing code.
//     It basically helps us write large amounts of code.
//  That is easier to change and manage.
// There are other ways like functional programming and procedural programming.
// Why we should use OOP?
//1) It help us to write large amounts of code easily .
//2)It also helps us represent the world aorund us inside computers easily.
//3) Changing code becomes easier.
//4) Sharing code and collaboration becomes easier.
//  MAIN CONCEPTS/ MAIN PILLARS OF OOP:
// 1) Classes and objects, (Base not considered main pillar)
// 2) Inheritance,
// 3)Polymorphism,
// 4)Abstraction,
// 5)Encapsulation.
// Classes and Objects:
// A class is like a map/blueprint/idea/design that we create before we
// start building the actual object. Classes have properties/attributes
// which helps us figure out how something looks like and they have behaviours.
