String Class:
String class, is designed to store symbols(letters(A,d,C), numbers(10,25),
special characters (#,$,%) in the form of a group.
There are many methods already written by java developers that we can just use.
This is the most widely used class in java.

for example:
lenght()
startsWith()
endWith()
contains() : checks if contains a specific word,letter

why we should learn about this class.
1) Very important for coding questions
2)Most widely used class in all java.
3)Most of the information in real life is present in the form of Strings.

Method Chaining:
When multiple methods are being called on the same line its called method chaining.
String class supports methods changing. For method changing to work previous method must return to the
expected datatype for the next method.
  String str="Batch 17 IS GREAT.";
        System.out.println(str.toLowerCase());
        System.out.println(str.toLowerCase().trim());
        System.out.println(str.toLowerCase().trim().replace("great","Good"));


note: Very Important for coding questions.
1) If else
2) Loops
3) Arrays
4) Strings
