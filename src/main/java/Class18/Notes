Super Keyword:
        Super Keyword is used to access things from the parent class.
        We can access instance variables, Methods and constructors.
Why should we learn about Super:
        1)Without Super() we can't call the constructor from the parent
        class and we might have to repeat hat constructor in all of
        class if someone decrease the fields private we will not be able
        to even acess the fields in child classes.
        2)We can use Super to call the fields from the parent class if we
        have same name fields in the child class.
Rules:
        1)When we use super () we must call at least one constructor
        from the parent class. because java needs at least one constructor
        from parent as it always first creates the object of the parent
        class when we create the object of the child class.
        2)When we have same same field as local instance and in the parent
        class as well. Java prefers the local first then the instance of the
        same class then the instance of parent class. However if we directly
        want to access the field from parent we can use Super keyword.
