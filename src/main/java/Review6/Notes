What is object oriented programming (OOP)
        It is simple a way of writing code.Some rules that we follow.
        There are other ways as well like functional programming, procedural programming.
        There are four main pillars of OOP
        1)Inheritance;
        2)Polymorphism;
        3)Abstraction;
        4)Encapsulation.
Why should we learn OOP:
        1)Code re-usability;
        2)It is easier to write large amount of code;
        3)Sharing code with others becomes easier;
        4)Security of the code is increased;
        5)Changing code becomes easier;
Objects:
       An object is something that we can physically touch. Everything around us like
       chairs, table, computer etc.
       They are all objects. We can easily represent these objects inside our computers
       by telling a computer how an object looks like and how it behaves.
Class:
        A class is like design/map/blueprint that we use to create objects.
String Class:
        A string class is used to store and manipulate text based data. Most of the information
        inside computers is processed in this form.
        String is most widely used class in all java.
Creating objects from String class:
        1)lenght()
        2)isEmpthy()
