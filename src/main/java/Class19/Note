Method Overloading:
    Method overloading happens when multiple methods with same name
    different parameter.
    1)Different number of parameter for example min(2,3) min(4,5,6)
    2)Different datatype of methods print("Java") print(12);
    3)Different sequence/order of parameters print ("Java",12),print(12,"Java")
Why should we learn about method overloading:
    1)Cleaner code
    2)We don't need to come up with different method names.

Syntax:
    class Calculator {

    int add(int a,int b){
    return a+b;
    }
    int add(int a,int b,int c){
        return a+b+c;
        }

    double add(double a,double b){
        return a+b;
        }

        long add(long a,long b){
            return a+b;

        }
    }
MethodOverriding:
    MethodOverRiding happens when same name method is present in parent as well as
    in child class.

Note:
    Signature of a method:
        Method name plus it is parameters are called
        signature of a method.
        example: add(int num1, int num2)
    Header of method:
        Header of a method includes signature + return method
        example:public void add(int num1, int num2, int num3)
Topics to revise for Selenium.
         classes and Objects
                 Methods
                 String methods
                 Loops
                 If-else

Approach:
   1)Read slides if something is not clear watch short videos from youtube
   for that specific topic
   2)Solve your HW/Replits again.
