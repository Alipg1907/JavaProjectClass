Constructors:
Constructor helps us build objects from classes easily.
They help us give initial values to the instance fields.
the name of the constructor must be same as the class name.
Constructor dont have any return types.
Most of the the times constructors are public.
Other han initializing the values we can have whatever types
of code inside the constructor that we like for example calling methods
writing if-else etc.

Class ClassName{
String name;
public ClassName(){

}
public ClassName(

}
