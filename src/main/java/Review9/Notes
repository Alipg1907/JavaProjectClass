SuperKeyword:
    Super keyword refers to parent class. We can use super-keyword
    to access variable, methods and constructor from the parent class.
Why we should use super keyword?
    1) To specifically call something from the parent class. Like a variable or method.
    2) We can use super() to call the constructor frm the parent.
MethodOverLoading:
    1)When we have same method with different parameters its called method overloading.
    Parameters can be different in 3 ways.
    a)We can change the count of the parameter. We can overload methods as well as constructors.
    b)We can also change the datatype of parameter if number of parameters are same.
    c)We can change the sequence if datatype and number of parameter are same.
Why we should use MethodOverLoading?
    1)Cleaner code. We don't have to come up with different method names.
    2)Reuse same name can be reused many times.
1)Can we OverLoad a private method?
YES !!
2)Can we overload a static method?
YES !!
3)Can we overload the main method?
YES !!
4)Can we overload a method by changing it's return type?
NO!!!
5) Can we overload a protected method?
YES !!
======================================
MethodOverriding:
When same method is present in parent as well as child class. It is
called method overriding. When we override a method java prefers the method
from the child class.
Why?
