//Logical Operators
//Logical Operators help combine multiple conditions
// on the same line If statement.
//They are three types of logical operators.
// --NOT(!) -- OR(||) AND (&&).
// NOT (!):
//true=>false
//false =>true
//Why should we use NOT operator;
//1) It can help us simplify the logic in some of the cases
//2)Code readability will in increase.
// **  OR(||) Operator
//Logical OR operators will help us combine multiple conditions in such
// a way that as soon as one condition gets rue the whole condition will be
// evaluated to true.
// true||False||true=true
//false||false||false||=false

//--AND (&&)
//Logical and operator will help us combine the conditions in such a
// way that it will only give us rue if the all conditions are true.
//True && false && true = false
// true && true && true = true
