MethodOverRiding
    When we have exact same methods in parent and child class. we call it
    method overriding.
Why should we learn about overriding:
    Method Overriding gives us a lot flexibility for example if we don't
    like a method from the parent class we can override it/change.

Syntax:
    Class Parent {

    void eat(){
    sout "Fish"
    }
    }
    class Child exdend Parent{
    void eat(){
    sout"Chicken"
    }
    }
