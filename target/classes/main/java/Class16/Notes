Constructors:
    Constructors help us create the objects from classes in a more secure and neat way.
    We can also put any piece of code that we want to execute when the
    object of a class is created.
Why we should use constructor?
    1)They help use write more secure classes
    2)Cleaner code
    3)More control over the values that we can assign to the instance fields.
Syntax:
    1)Usually public access modifier.
    2)Same name as class name
    3)No return type not even void.
    4)Parameter
    5)Body of the constructor.
