Interface:
    Interfaces are like contracts.In which we define abstract methods
    which the classes have to implement.They can also have public static
    final variable.
Why should we learn about interfaces?
    1)Specially designed for abstraction
    2)Light weight as compared to abstract classes.
    3)We can achieve multiple inheritance in interfaces.
    4)There is no Diamond problem when having multiple inheritance.
    5)Help us build things in a modular way can be used with classes
    even if they are not closely related.
Rules:
    1)Interfaces don't have instance methods but can have static methods.
    2)No instance fields are allowed. All the fields inside an interface
    are public static final.
    3)No constructor are allowed.
    4)We can not create object interface as there are no constructors.
    5)Can't have final keyword with interface or method as they are
    default abstract.
    6)We can have multiple inheritance as there is no Diamond problem.
    7)We use implements keyword when we have to implement an interface.
