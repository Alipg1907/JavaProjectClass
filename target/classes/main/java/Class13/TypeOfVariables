Types of Variables:
    There are three types of variables.
    -local;
    -instance;
    -static.

    local variables:
    local variables are the variables which are created, declared
    inside a block of code. Like if else conditions, oop, switch statements,
    methods are
    block of code.
    Upside:
    They occupy the memory for shortest period of time. As soon as java is done
    executing that block of code they are removed  from the memory
        Local variables are always better for Debug ! easierto see it
     downside:
     They can only be accessed within the block of code they are created.

          --Instance variable:
      Instance variable are the the variable which are created outside
      of the blocks (if else, switch, loops or methods etc.) of code but inside a class.
               --Upside:
       They can be accessed any where within the that class.
                  --Downside:
       They are created when an object of the class is created and they will
       stay in the memory as long as that object is in the memory
       weather you use it or not.
           ---Local vs instance:
          *Whenever it is possible go and create local variable.
          *Only go with instance variable when you can't solve a problem with ocl variable.

      Static Variables:
          ---Static variables are created inside a class but outside of a block of code
      with a static keyword.
      ---*** Local variable can never be a static variable!!!!****
                 --Upside
          They are universal when it comes to scope and accessibility.
          We don;t even need to create the object of that class in which
           they are created. We can simply write the name of the class

          -Downside
         Static variables occupy the memory for longest of all.
            They are created even though you don't create any object of that
            class.


        Uses of types of local variables:
        Local:
        When ever we are solving any problem many times we need local variables
        to temporarily store data. In all of those cases you should be going with
        local variables.
