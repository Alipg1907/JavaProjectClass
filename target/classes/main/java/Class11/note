Methods/Functions/Behaviours/Routines
    Methods are are blocks of code that contains pre-written code that is executed.
    When we call a methods

 ----There are two types of methods:
       1)Methods which do not return any data ( void type)
       2)Methods which can return data like int double char etc.


           ==========
           datatype methodName (datatype nameOfParameter, dataType nameOfOtherParam){
           this is where we write the logic
           return the results if method type is not void

           }

        Syntax:
        int add ( int num1,int num2){
                   int result=num1+num2;
                   return result;
                   }
          int=> return type of method
          add=> nma eof the method
          (int num1,int num2) => parameters
          {   =>>>> Body of the method
          int result = num1+num2
