Inheritance:
    Inheritance allows one clas to have all he properties and
    methods from another class.
    **Except private members and constructors.
    We use extends keyword.
Why should we learn about inheritance:
    1)Faster development;
    2)Saves memory
Syntax:
    Class Parent{

   }
    class Child extends Parents{

    }
    Rules:
        1)Private members are not accessible in child classes.
        2)Constructors are also no available for child classes directly.
    Types of inheritance:
        1)Single
        2)Hierarchical
        3)MultiLevel
        4)Hybrid
        5)Multiple (It is not supported by java)
    Single Inheritance:
        Only one parent and only one child ( Not very Common)
    Hierarchical:
        One parent multiple child.
     MultiLevel:
        Multilevel inheritance happens when a class C inherits fromB and B inherits from A.
    Hybrid:
   Hybrid is a mixture of hierarchical and multilevel.

    Multiple
    Multiple inheritance not allowed in java meaning a class cant inherent from
    multiple class at the same time. they called 'DIAMOND PROBLEM'
    What is Diamond problem in OOP?
    "The ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A,
    and a further class D inherits from both
    B and C, so that if there is a method in A that B and/or C has overridden,
    and D does not override it, it is unclear which version of the method D should inherit."
